### Files Contents:

1. **`seed.sql`**:
   - This script inserts sample data into each of the tables: `User`, `Property`, `Booking`, `Payment`, `Review`, and `Message`.
   - Each table has realistic data, such as users with different roles (guest, host, admin), properties with descriptions and prices, 
   bookings with status, reviews with ratings, and messages exchanged between users.

2. **`README.md`**:
   - This markdown file explains the purpose of the seed script and provides instructions on how to execute it in a PostgreSQL 
   or MySQL environment.
   - It also describes the types of sample data being inserted into the database.

By running this script, you'll populate your database with realistic data, which can help you test the functionality and 
performance of your AirBnB-like application. Add these files to the `database-script-0x02` directory in your GitHub repository 
as instructed.
